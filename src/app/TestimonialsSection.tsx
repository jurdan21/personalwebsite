    text: `Jurdan truly exceeded our expectations. The landing page he designed for Tomcspace not only looked clean and professional, but also helped double our website traffic within just a few weeks. He listened carefully to our goals and translated them into a design that works â€” both visually and strategically. I'd absolutely recommend him to anyone who needs high-performing product pages.`,

    text: `I remember when Feedloop.ai needed a strong UI/UX designer and ultimately decided to hire Jurdan. At that time, Jurdan had only been learning UI/UX design for 6 months, yet he was already able to showcase a remarkably mature and impressive portfolio. What a fast learner, I thought. Since then, we've collaborated on several projects for Feedloop.ai and other clients. Jurdan is incredibly reliable in delivering high-quality work on time. His kind and helpful nature makes him a valuable team player who's always willing to support colleagues, and his positive energy as a natural mood maker creates an enjoyable work environment for everyone. Jurdan combines strong technical design skills with outstanding interpersonal qualities, making him an asset to any team. I highly recommend him for any UI/UX design role.`,
